**Phylogenetic analysis**

According to Kaznadzey et al. (2018), growth of the _E. coli_ culture on lactose as a sole carbon source resulted in the significantly enhanced expression of four _yih_ genes, notably _yihS_, _yihT_, _yihV_, _yihW_. Therefore, we further refer to these genes as "core" genes, presumably having multifunctional characteristics. Assessing protein phylogenetic trees, we selected organisms that possessed a cassette consisting of at least three core _yih_ genes.

The folder **`figures_trees`** contains figures of Yih protein phylogenetic trees of close homologs. Each protein in each tree is encoded within the cassette that consists of at least 3 out of 4 'core' _yih_ genes. Cassette composition is shown opposite to the terminal node if a _yih_ gene coding for the respective protein is co-localized with at least one other _yih_ gene; otherwise, the area next to the leaf remains black. Gene colouring is the same as on the picture below



The file **`blastp_merged_cassette.csv`** is a summary table on all Yih homologs obtained with both "phmmer + blastp" and "nsimscan + blastp" approaches.  Cassette composition was determined as follows: two yih gene homologs were considered as co-localized if the distance between their middle coordinates on the genome was less than 10 000 nucleotides
